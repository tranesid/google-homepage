This current project is testing my ability to replicate the google.com homepage with the searchbox. 
At first I was quite confused. 
Then after checking other student samples I figured out how I was supposed to be doing this. 
It's my first time actually building something!
About halfway through the process it really clicked using Chrome devtools to deconstruct the layout of the page and that was incredibly helpful.
The live server extension I downloaded was not very helpful as it wasn't working very well so I used codepen to see live updates of my work. That is extremely helpful.
